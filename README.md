**Claude Code and Codex, from your phone.**

A browser and phone client for [herdr](https://github.com/herdrdev/herdr). Read and reply to the same agent sessions running on your computer — on desktop or phone, as chat, with the terminal when you need it.

- **Chat and terminal, one pane** — native Claude Code, Codex, omp, omo, gjc and pi transcripts, with the live terminal a click away. [Supported agents →](docs/guide.md#supported-agents)
- **Approve with a tap** — approvals, questions and plan menus become cards, checked to be current before your answer is sent.
- **Know when you're needed** — live status for every pane and push alerts when an agent needs input or finishes, even with the app closed.
- **Install it on your phone** — a PWA with Esc, Tab, Ctrl and arrows above the keyboard, and a QR code to your Tailscale address. [Phone setup →](docs/guide.md#on-your-phone)
- **Speak instead of typing** — dictate into the chat or the terminal line, Korean and English mixed. Nothing goes out until you send it; it uses your own OpenAI key or the browser's speech recognition.
- **Keep your workflow** — herdr owns the agents; this app connects to them. Update from Settings without stopping them. [All features →](docs/guide.md#features)

## install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://devswha.github.io/herdr-web-ui/install.sh | sh
```

Linux (x64, arm64) or macOS. Installs missing herdr 0.9.0+, Bun 1.4+ and Node 18+ prerequisites for your user, then installs the app as a herdr plugin. If an existing herdr installation is older than 0.9.0, update and restart herdr yourself before rerunning the installer. With the default listen address and Tailscale running, successful HTTPS setup provides a tailnet address and QR code.

Windows x64, in PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://devswha.github.io/herdr-web-ui/install.ps1 | iex
```

Requires [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win). Installs missing herdr and Bun for your user, then installs the same plugin. No Node or WSL is needed. Open **Phone setup** in herdr for phone access. Windows terminals use the [screen mirror](docs/remote-pcs.md#windows-pcs), with typing and a fixed grid, until herdr supports terminal attach there.

  <img src="docs/screenshots/install.png" width="720" alt="Installer output: Bun, Node and the herdr plugin install, then tailscale serve publishes the app and a QR code for the phone appears.">
</p>

Already have the prerequisites? Install just the plugin:

```bash
herdr plugin install devswha/herdr-web-ui
```

With herdr running, open **[localhost:7317](http://localhost:7317)**. Pick a pane or start an agent with **New workspace**. To use your phone, scan the installer's QR code and add the app to your home screen. [Quick start →](docs/guide.md#quick-start)

The server listens on `127.0.0.1` by default. For access from another device, see [phone setup](docs/guide.md#on-your-phone) and [access and safety](docs/guide.md#access-and-safety).
